In the presentation that i've created, you would be able to find the general information about my application; how i've created the application and the basic coding that guided me through in order to create a successful application, using App Inventor 2.

This website, the app and the powerpoint has been created by Dong Jae Rhee, KIS freshmen. It was created by the usage of Atom, github and Jekyll Themes in order to represent and provide information for my app, Fashion Finder. My application may have some less advancements of coding, when compared to others, nevertheless, this website was to backup the difference between my application and others.
